# Commonroom

A small, command-driven chatroom: Rust + Axum, a declarative Preact frontend,
and one portable SQLite data folder. No external database, public account signup,
third-party fonts, or runtime Node server. Built for a small, trusted circle.

## Development

Requires Rust 1.89+ (edition 2024), Node 20.19+ or 22.12+, pnpm, and RTK.
All shell commands below use RTK.

```sh
rtk pnpm --dir web install
rtk cargo run
```

In the Rust process's stdin, create accounts:

```text
/user alice a-long-unique-password admin
/user bob another-unique-password user
```

In another terminal:

```sh
rtk pnpm --dir web dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**. Vite proxies HTTP authentication and plain
WebSockets to Rust at `127.0.0.1:3000`. Account names are case sensitive.
Passwords require at least 3 characters and at most 128 bytes; stdin account commands use a single password
token without whitespace. Credentials and message bodies are never logged.

To inspect a built debug artifact without Vite:

```sh
rtk proxy ./build.sh debug
rtk proxy ./debug.sh
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**. `debug.sh` runs `target/debug/chat` and keeps
stdin available for superuser commands. The debug build embeds a development
web bundle from `web/dist-debug`; release builds use the production bundle
from `web/dist`. Both use `data/` by default and respect `CHAT_DATA` and saved
settings. A data folder configured for production still requires its HTTPS
proxy, even when started with a debug binary.

## Commands

Admins start in a local Command view and can register or manage accounts there. Rooms and private conversations use foldable navigation lists.
New accounts have no room memberships. Type messages or commands in the composer. Enter sends; Shift + Enter adds
a line. Use `/help` for commands grouped into General, Account, Rooms, Messages, and Server, filtered by your role. Typing `/`
shows contextual command and argument hints; arrow keys select a hint, Tab
completes it, and Escape closes the hints. Enter executes what you typed.
Chat messages use a Discord-style layout, all aligned on the left, with the
sender and local time above the text. Consecutive
messages from one sender are grouped within five minutes; commands break the
group. Dates, times, and date separators follow the browser timezone, with the
full local date and timezone available on timestamp hover. The server stores
Unix timestamps in seconds. Commands and replies retain their console format
alongside chat messages, only in your current tab and the view where the command ran.
The Command view has its own local history. Private messages are grouped by
person; only people you have exchanged private messages with appear in the list. Start a
new private conversation with `/tell person message`; typing in a private conversation is equivalent to `/tell person message`. Reloading clears command output and
fetches a 50-message tail per room and per private conversation. Opening a
conversation fetches its retained history; `/history 200` also prints more
retained messages as local command output. `/clear`
clears the local display without deleting server history; refresh restores it.
The URL remembers the selected room, so refresh returns to the same conversation.
Every permission check happens on the server.

Orange badges count messages from other people that you have not read. Opening
an unread conversation starts at its first unread message; **Jump to unread**
returns to the next unread message while you browse history. Only messages
viewed in a focused, visible conversation advance the read position. Unread
counts sync across your devices and survive restarting or moving `data/`.
Commands and reactions do not add unread messages. Histories evicted by the
retention limit no longer contribute to the count.

Message actions appear on hover (always on touch devices). Use **Reply** to
quote a message in the composer, or **+** to choose an emoji/custom UTF-8
reaction. Clicking a reaction toggles your participation. Reactions allow
1–16 Unicode characters without control characters, with at most 32 distinct
reactions per message. Reactions and replies are persisted for both rooms and
private conversations; only conversation participants may use them. Quoted
replies keep the original author's name and a 160-character preview even after
the original message expires. The quote jumps to the original if it is loaded.

Type `@username` to mention a room member or the other private-chat participant;
name completion appears as you type. Names are case-sensitive. The server
records mentions only for participants in that conversation; email addresses
are not treated as mentions. Text and custom reactions remain UTF-8.

For desktop Chrome notifications, click the bell next to your profile and
allow notifications in the browser prompt. Production needs HTTPS; localhost
works for development. The setting is remembered per browser origin.
Notifications arrive for new mentions while the page is open and its WebSocket
is connected, when the page is in the background or a different conversation
is selected. Reading the same conversation in the foreground suppresses the
notification. Clicking a notification opens its conversation. Reactions,
refresh, history joins and reconnect snapshots do not replay notifications.
Notifications are not push delivery to a closed browser/tab, and browser/OS
notification settings can block them. Private message previews can appear in
system notifications only after you opt in.

The Settings button beside your profile adjusts chat text (14–24px) and UI
text (12–18px) independently, with a live preview and Reset defaults. These
preferences stay in this browser; they do not change the server configuration.
Room and private-chat lists share a scrollable sidebar area; the profile stays
fixed below it. Joined rooms and private peers come from the server on login,
socket reconnect and when the page returns to the foreground. An older HTTP
refresh cannot overwrite a newer WebSocket snapshot.


| Command | Who | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/help` | Everyone | Show the command reference |
| `/whoami` | Everyone | Show your name and permission (`user` or `admin`) |
| `/passwd old new` | Web users | Verify your old password, change it, and sign out other sessions; current session stays logged in |
| `/rooms` | Everyone | List your rooms; admins can discover all rooms |
| `/users` | Everyone | List active account names and permissions |
| `/members [room]` | Everyone | List members of a room you belong to |
| `/history [count] [user]` | Everyone | Read retained messages (default up to 50; per-room and per-private-conversation limit from `max_messages`); private view uses the selected person |
| `/join room` | Everyone | Open a room you already belong to; admins can join any room |
| `/leave [room]` | Everyone | Leave the specified or selected room; an admin must add regular users back |
| `/tell user message` | Everyone | Private message, visible only to sender and recipient |
| `/react message-id reaction` | Web users | Toggle your reaction on a retained message in the selected room or your private history |
| `/reply message-id message` | Web users | Reply in the selected room, or to the other participant of a private message |
| `/new room` | Admin or stdin | Create a room; the web admin becomes its first member |
| `/add user [room]` | Admin or stdin | Add an existing account; defaults to the selected room in the web UI |
| `/kick user [room]` | Admin or stdin | Revoke room access immediately |
| `/delete room` | Admin or stdin | Delete room and history |
| `/grant user` | Admin or stdin | Grant administrator permission |
| `/revoke user` | Admin or stdin | Restore user permission; web cannot revoke the last active admin |
| `/configs` | Admin or stdin | Print the active configuration; values require restart to change |
| `/clean age [room\|@private\|@all]` | Admin or stdin | Delete messages older than an age; units `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, `w` |
| `/clear` | Web only | Clear local console output and visible chat without deleting persisted messages |
| `/logout` | Web only | Sign out |
| `/user name password [admin\|user]` | Admin or stdin | Create an account; default role is user |
| `/reset name password` | Admin or stdin | Reset password and revoke all login sessions |
| `/disable name` | Admin or stdin | Disable account, revoke sessions, and remove memberships |
| `/enable name` | Admin or stdin | Enable account without restoring room memberships; old sessions stay revoked |
| `/deleteuser name` | Admin or stdin | Permanently delete account, sessions, memberships, reactions, read positions, and its private conversations; retain room messages as `name (deleted)` |

`/deleteuser bob` permanently removes Bob's account and private conversations
for both participants. Shared room messages and reply quotes remain, with their
author labeled `bob (deleted)`. The username and user-limit slot become available
again; a replacement account starts without old memberships, DMs, or read
positions. Web admins cannot delete themselves or the last active admin; stdin
can remove any account and create a replacement administrator. Use `/disable`
for a reversible account suspension.

There is no default room. Existing rooms are preserved, including rooms named
`lobby`, which can be deleted like any other room. Rooms are invitation-only for regular users;
admins explicitly control membership. Stdin is the superuser and can manage
all rooms; specify the room on stdin. Account command passwords, including both `/passwd` arguments, are masked in local output and never logged.
`/clean 7d room-name` cleans one room; `/clean 24h @private` cleans private messages;
`/clean 7d @all` cleans all rooms and private messages. Without a scope it uses
the selected room, or all messages in Command and stdin. Cleanup keeps messages
at or newer than the cutoff and reports the number removed. It preserves rooms,
accounts, and memberships. Cleanup is manual and uses stored UTC timestamps.
There is no runtime configuration setter: `/configs` shows the loaded settings,
and editing `data/config.json` takes effect after restart.
Web admins do not receive private
messages between other users. `/tell` opens the private-message view in the UI.
Names contain 1–32 ASCII letters, digits, `_`, or `-`.

## Build and run

To build manually:

```sh
rtk pnpm --dir web install
rtk pnpm --dir web build
rtk cargo build --release
rtk proxy cp target/release/chat ./chat
```

Builds can also use `rtk proxy ./build.sh`. The script generates
missing lockfiles on its first run and uses frozen/locked dependencies on
subsequent runs. Both lockfiles are included for reproducible builds. The script
itself uses ordinary commands; RTK only wraps your invocation. Release compilation requires a built
frontend. Assets are embedded into `chat`, so neither `web/` nor Node
is needed on the destination server. A debug binary embeds assets if they
exist at compile time; normally development uses Vite instead.

First production start:

```sh
rtk proxy env CHAT_ORIGIN=https://chat.example.com ./chat
```

Put the server behind Nginx; [deploy/nginx.conf](deploy/nginx.conf) is a
location-only include for `/commonroom/`. Place it inside your existing HTTPS
`server {}` block (under `http {}`). Nginx does not allow `location` directly
inside `http`. Your existing server supplies TLS certificates and HTTP-to-HTTPS
redirection. Match `base_url` to the location prefix. The example preserves
the prefix when forwarding; do not add a trailing slash to `proxy_pass`.
For root hosting, set `base_url` to `/` and use a single `location /` proxy.
Validate with `rtk proxy nginx -t` before reloading Nginx.

Release binaries require HTTPS, check request origins, set secure HttpOnly
cookies scoped to `base_url`, send HSTS and CSP, and reject requests without
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. The frontend redirects HTTP to HTTPS and uses
`wss:` in production. The proxy must overwrite forwarded headers. Production
requests must arrive from the exact socket-peer IP configured in `trust`;
forwarded headers cannot override that check. Keep the backend listener private
and restrict remote proxy deployments to the configured source IP. The Rust
backend deliberately does not terminate TLS.

The proxy upgrade headers follow the [official Nginx WebSocket guidance](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html).

Settings are saved as key-value pairs in `data/config.json`. Edit this file
while the service is stopped, then restart to apply changes. Example for Nginx
on the same machine:

```json
{
  "production": true,
  "bind": "127.0.0.1:3000",
  "trust": "127.0.0.1",
  "base_url": "/commonroom/",
  "max_users": 64,
  "max_rooms": 64,
  "max_messages": 1000,
  "origins": ["https://domain.com"]
}
```

`bind` is the single HTTP listener: it serves the embedded frontend, `/api/`
endpoints, and WebSockets at `/ws` on the same port (3000 by default).
`base_url` prefixes all these paths at runtime without rebuilding the frontend:
`/commonroom/`, `/commonroom/api/login`, `/commonroom/ws`. It defaults to `/`
and accepts path segments containing letters, digits, `-`, and `_`; a trailing
slash is added automatically. It is a path, not a full URL. Nginx
exposes HTTPS and WSS on port 443 and forwards both to this listener.
`trust` is a single proxy IP address, defaulting to `127.0.0.1`; use the load
balancer's actual source IP for a remote proxy, and bind to a reachable private
address. Trust is enforced in production. Existing config files without
`trust` receive the default automatically. Release builds always enforce
production mode; debug builds use the saved `production` setting.
`max_users` and `max_rooms` are positive integers, each defaulting to 64.
They limit new account and room creation through both web commands and stdin.
Disabled accounts count toward `max_users`. Lowering a limit preserves existing
accounts and rooms while preventing new creation until the count is below it.
`max_messages` is a positive integer, defaulting to 1000 for each room and each
private conversation. Each new message evicts the oldest when that conversation
is full, keeping the newest messages. A busy private conversation does not
evict another person's history. Lowering this limit trims and saves both room
and private histories at startup. Queue append/eviction is O(1); message saves
still serialize the retained application state. Read positions use a separate
SQLite table with indexed, monotonic updates and do not rewrite message data.
Restart after editing these values.

### Cloudflare Tunnel (without Nginx)

Cloudflare Tunnel can connect directly to this HTTP server and supports the
same WebSocket endpoint. For a named tunnel, map your public hostname to
`http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Use [deploy/cloudflared.yml](deploy/cloudflared.yml)
for a locally managed tunnel, or enter that service URL in the Cloudflare dashboard.
Run `cloudflared` on the same machine with:

```json
{
  "production": true,
  "bind": "127.0.0.1:3000",
  "trust": "127.0.0.1",
  "base_url": "/",
  "origins": ["https://chat.example.com"],
  "max_users": 64,
  "max_rooms": 64,
  "max_messages": 1000
}
```

Set the public hostname to your actual domain. Enable HTTPS redirects at
Cloudflare (Always Use HTTPS) and keep WebSockets enabled. The backend checks
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https`, which Cloudflare supplies for HTTPS visitors;
its own connection from `cloudflared` remains HTTP. No separate WebSocket route
or TLS certificate is needed on this server. Use `127.0.0.1` rather than
`localhost` in the service URL so the socket peer matches `trust`. If your
connector is on another machine or in a container, adjust `bind` and `trust`
to the reachable address and actual connector source IP.

Cloudflare Tunnel preserves request paths. For `/commonroom/`, set that
`base_url` and forward the path unchanged. Do not cache `/api/*` or `/ws`
(or their base-path equivalents) using custom Cloudflare cache rules.
The app reconnects if a tunnel restart interrupts an existing WebSocket.

Protocol compatibility is verified with production HTTP/WebSocket checks;
a real public tunnel still needs an end-to-end check on your own hostname.
See Cloudflare's [routing documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/concepts/routing/),
[WebSocket support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/faq/cloudflare-tunnels-faq/),
and [forwarded headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/http-headers/).

`origins` checks the browser Origin header for login, logout, read acknowledgements, and WebSockets.
It contains scheme + host + optional port, never a path; for
`https://domain.com/commonroom/`, the origin is `https://domain.com`.
Production uses one HTTPS origin. `trust` checks the proxy IP separately.

Subsequent starts need only:

```sh
rtk proxy ./chat
```

Environment settings:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CHAT_DATA` | Data-folder location; defaults to `./data` relative to the working directory |
| `CHAT_ORIGIN` | Public HTTPS origin, no path or trailing slash; required on first production start and saved |
| `CHAT_BIND` | Listener; defaults to `127.0.0.1:3000`, saved when overridden |
| `CHAT_TRUST` | Trusted proxy IP; defaults to `127.0.0.1`, saved when overridden |
| `CHAT_BASE_URL` | Hosting path; defaults to `/`, saved when overridden |
| `CHAT_PRODUCTION=1` | Exercise production security in a debug binary |
| `RUST_LOG` | Log filter; defaults to `chat=info,tower_http=info` |

Changing `CHAT_BIND`, `CHAT_TRUST`, `CHAT_BASE_URL`, or `CHAT_ORIGIN` persists the change.
Environment overrides take precedence over saved values. Production settings
cannot be silently downgraded by running a debug binary. A release binary
always enforces production security, including when upgrading a development
data folder; provide `CHAT_ORIGIN` the first time you upgrade it.

Logs go to stdout. To redirect them while preserving the stdin console:

```sh
rtk proxy ./chat > chat.log 2>&1
```

Closing stdin leaves the web service running. Ctrl + C or SIGTERM stops it
gracefully and checkpoints SQLite. No default account or password is shipped.

## Data upgrades

Schema v3 automatically migrates v1/v2 data folders, preserving accounts,
sessions, message IDs, replies, mentions, and reactions. Existing retained
history starts as read. Migration commits the new private conversations and
read baselines together. Messages previously evicted by older versions cannot
be recovered. Back up `data/` with the server stopped before upgrading; older
binaries cannot open the upgraded schema.

## Move to another machine

1. Stop the old server with Ctrl + C or SIGTERM. Wait for it to exit.
2. Copy the **entire `data/` folder** to the new machine, preserving it privately.
3. Place a compatible `chat` binary built for that machine's OS/architecture
   beside `data/`. Start it from that directory with `rtk proxy ./chat`.
4. Route the same public HTTPS hostname to the new machine and keep the proxy
   configuration equivalent. If the hostname changes, set `CHAT_ORIGIN` on
   the next start; browser cookies are tied to the original hostname.

```text
service/
├── chat                 # destination-platform binary, includes frontend
└── data/
    ├── config.json      # listener, public origin, production mode
    ├── chat.sqlite      # accounts, password hashes, rooms, memberships,
    │                    # messages, read positions, and unexpired login sessions
    └── chat.lock        # exclusive OS lock; safe to move after shutdown
```

SQLite may also have `chat.sqlite-wal` and `chat.sqlite-shm`; copy the whole
folder, never just the database while it is running. The stored format uses
portable SQLite and JSON, with no machine-specific paths or secrets outside
the data folder. Only one process can use a folder at once. Compatible newer
binaries read schemas v1/v2 and migrate them to v3 without discarding retained
accounts or messages. Schema v3 adds per-conversation private queues and durable
read positions; older binaries reject unknown newer schema versions. Browser login sessions keep their original 12-hour expiry across
restart and migration. Accounts, roles, memberships, message timestamps and
IDs remain the same. Proxy certificates, DNS, and OS-specific binaries are
deployment infrastructure and must be supplied on the destination.

On Unix, startup restricts the data directory to its owner (`0700`). This
folder contains private messages and active session credentials; keep
backups private as well.

## Verification

```sh
rtk cargo fmt --all --check
rtk cargo test
rtk cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
rtk pnpm --dir web test
rtk proxy ./build.sh
rtk cargo build
rtk pnpm --dir web test:integration
```

Unit tests cover room authorization, private-message visibility, password
hashes, bounded history, account disabling, persistence, session revocation,
and moving state to a new directory. The integration script starts a fresh
debug server with an isolated temporary data folder and verifies HTTP login,
WebSocket commands, privacy, origin checks, revocation, and restart after
migration. It also starts the release binary from a directory without web
assets and checks embedded HTML/JS/CSS, HTTPS enforcement, secure cookies,
security headers, WebSocket origin rejection, and logout disconnection.
It never uses your real `data/`.

## Layout and protocol

```text

  build.rs               # embed the frontend at compile time
  src/main.rs            # process lifecycle and stdin console
  src/config.rs          # saved settings, defaults, environment overrides
  src/engine.rs          # commands, permissions, portable storage

debug.sh                 # run the built debug artifact

```

HTTP endpoints: `POST /api/login`, `POST /api/logout`, `GET /api/me`, and
`GET /api/health`. Authentication uses same-origin cookies; no bearer tokens
are exposed to JavaScript. `GET /ws` requires a valid session and an allowed
Origin. Client frames are JSON `{ "id": 1, "room": "lobby", "text": "hello" }`.
The server acknowledges the request ID with `notice` or `error`, then sends
an authorization-filtered `snapshot` containing account metadata, accessible
rooms and the latest 50 messages, only the user's private messages, and
role-appropriate command metadata for hints. Replies go only to the requesting
socket and are never stored in chat history. The browser keeps at most 200
local command entries in memory; it does not use localStorage or sessionStorage
for them. Reconnect fetches
the current state. The client preserves an unacknowledged draft and asks the
user to check history before resending it.

History is deliberately bounded: `max_messages` messages per room (1000 by default) and the last 200
private messages across the service. Accounts and rooms are bounded by the saved `max_users` and `max_rooms`
settings (64 each by default). There are at most 256 sessions and 128
simultaneous sockets. UTF-8 messages allow 4000 Unicode characters, including
emoji and combining marks;
sockets are limited to 30 submissions per 10 seconds and use heartbeats.
Login attempts are limited to 10 per minute per peer IP (shared by users
behind the same proxy). Snapshots and transactional SQLite writes keep the
implementation small. Room histories use a deque: append and oldest-message
eviction are amortized O(1), with O(1) eviction once full. The entire send is
not O(1): rollback copies, JSON serialization, and SQLite state writes still
scale with the total retained data. This is a single-process service for a few users,
not a distributed chat platform. Multiple application replicas must not
share the data folder. Replacing the frontend requires rebuilding the binary.

## Current validation status

Verified on October 8, 2026:

- Rust formatting passes, and all 27 unit tests pass.
- All 15 frontend tests pass, including timezone, mentions, notification deduplication,
  saved font preferences and invalid browser storage,
  and resuming a stale conversation list without overwriting newer socket updates.
- Clippy passes for all targets with warnings denied.
- Web production build and Rust debug/release builds pass.
- HTTP/WebSocket integration tests pass, including data-folder migration and
  room/private reactions and replies, mention metadata, second-device login/reconnect
  directories, and production security checks.
- Browser checks pass for login, room creation and selection, message delivery,
  desktop layout, and the mobile navigation drawer. No browser warnings or
  errors were observed during these checks.
- Build-script shell syntax passes. Nginx configuration validation is deferred
  to deployment because Nginx is not installed in the verification environment;
  run `nginx -t` after setting the hostname and certificate paths.

Read-only commands avoid copying or writing stored state and do not broadcast
snapshots. Successful mutations notify connected clients. The client memoizes
conversation ordering and rendered messages, so typing does not repeatedly sort
and format the transcript. Password checks and hashing run off the async thread.
